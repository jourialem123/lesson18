    <p>The orange, also called sweet orange to distinguish it from the bitter orange (Citrus  aurantium), is the fruit of a
    tree in the family Rutaceae. Botanically, this is the hybrid Citrus × sinensis, between the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and
    the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo.
    There are many related hybrids including of mandarins and sweet orange. The sweet orange has had its full genome
    sequenced.
    
    The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar; the earliest mention of the
    sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical areas for
    their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh or processed for its juice or fragrant peel. In 2022,
    76 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 22% of the total, followed by India and China.
    
    Oranges, variously understood, have featured in human culture since ancient times. They first appear in Western art in
    the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, but they had been depicted in Chinese art centuries earlier, as in Zhao
    Lingrang's Song dynasty fan painting Yellow Oranges and Green Tangerines. By the 17th century, an orangery had become an
    item of prestige in Europe, as seen at the Versailles Orangerie. More recently, artists such as Vincent van Gogh, John
    Sloan, and Henri Matisse included oranges in their paintings. </p>
